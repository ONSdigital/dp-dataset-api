  description: |
    Dataset catalogue used to find information about data published by the ONS.

    `Datasets` are published in unique `versions`, which are categorized by `edition`. Data in each version is broken down by `dimensions`, and a unique combination of dimension `options` in a version can be used to retrieve `observation` level data.

    Note: As of the latest update, the `@context` field has been removed from all dataset endpoints to improve response performance and correct data structure."
